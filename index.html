							<h3>Current Research</h3>

							<p>
								<b>Testing the ngVLA prototype antenna</b>
								<br>I am a member of the team testing the ngVLA prototype antenna at NRAO. This includes studying 
								RFI contributions, performing holography measurments of the antenna surface, and integrating the 
								prototype antenna into the existing VLA.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Mutual Coupling in low frequency radio interferometers</b>
								<br>Mutual coupling and antenna-to-antenna reflections cause excess correlation in observations with 
								low frequency radio interferometers. This is especially concerning for 21 cm cosmology. I have built 
								models in FEKO determine how strong mutual coupling is and how it changes as more antennas are added. 
								These results are compared to semi-analytic models of mutual coupling to determine how accurate these 
								parameterized models are for use in visibility predictions and calibration pipelines. 
							</p>

							<h3>Past Research</h3>

							<p>
								<b>Cable Reflections in the OVRO-LWA</b>
								<br>I worked with Dr. Daniel Jacobs during the Phase 3 EoR commissioning of the OVRO-LWA radio 
								telescope. I used observations to study how the upgrade affected the amount of cable reflections 
								present. I wrote code in Python to create 2-D power spectra of the Phase 3 observations and compared 
								to historic observations to determine if the severity of cable reflections had been reduced with the 
								upgrade.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Low reflectivity surface treatments for a spectrograph optical table</b>
								<br>I worked with Dr. Nathaniel Butler on the EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE). 
								Because the spectrograph is made of reflective metal, there was a concern over scattered light 
								making its way into the detector. To minimize this issue, I researched possible low reflectivity 
								surface treatments to coat the inside of the spectrograph. I modeled the light scattering and thermal 
								emission properties of each treatment in python to compare to the theoretical noise level requirement.  
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>Stress in transition edge sensor-based bolometers</b>
								<br>Summer research internship at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center under the supervision of Dr. Edward 
								J. Wollack and Dr. Karwan Rostem 
								<br>I studied sources of stress in cryogenically cooled transition edge sensor (TES) based bolometers. 
								I built models in COMSOL and simulated the fabrication process of the bolometers to determine what 
								caused the existing bolometers produced by the HIRMES team for an experiment on SOFIA to deform.

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Maintenance on a 16-inch optical telescope</b>
								<br>Semester research at CSU Fresno under the supervision of Dr. Fredrick Ringwald
								<br>I performed maintenance on Fresno State's station at Sierra Remote Observatories. This included 
								updating the computers, mounting a camera on the 16-inch telescope, commissioning replacement hardware, 
								and other routine maintenance required. 

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Signal leakage in the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</b>
								<br>Summer internship at ASU working with Dr. Daniel Jacobs. 
								<br>I worked with the HERA radio telescope to study the source of signal leakage in the 
								cross-polarization data. I wrote code in CASA and Python to create 2-D and 3-D power spectra. 
								I then created a mathematical model of the possible sources and compared to the real observations.

							<h3>Mentoring</h3>

							<p>
								<b><a href="https://calbridge.org/">Cal-Bridge</a></b>
								<br>I have been a peer mentor with Cal-Bridge since 2020. This has included one-on-one mentoring for 
								undergradute students and volunteering at workshops on applying to graduate school, 
								mental health in college, and research and scientific coding.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b><a href="https://loco.lab.asu.edu/">LoCo Lab</a></b>
								<br>From the summer of 2021 to the summer of 2025, I acted as a mentor to the undergraduate students working 
								in the LoCo lab. During the school year, I provided advice and answers to research questions for the ASU students 
								who conduct research as part of the lab. During the summers, I acted as a research mentor to the summer 
								interns who are employed in the lab.
							</p>

							<h3>Outreach and Science Communication</h3>
							<p>
								<b>Low Frequency Cosmology (LoCo) Lab Graduate Student Representative</b>
								<br>I epresented the LoCo lab at various outreach events with SESE at ASU, along with other students. 
								This included answering questions about the research in the lab, leading demonstrations, and overseeing 
								the undergraduate student representatives.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Fresno State Downing Planetarium Assistant</b>
								<br>I worked with the head of the Planetarium, Dr. White, on the science communication aspects of running
								the Planetarium. This included leading visiting school groups through crafts about astronomy, leading 
								guided tours of the museum, and giving science demonstrations. During the monthly shows open to the 
								public, I assisted with customer service aspects of the job as well as setting up and operating the 
								telescope.
							</p>
							<h3>Teaching</h3>
							<p>
								<b>ASU</b>
								<br>I taught the Introduction to Astronomy - Laboratory at ASU for two years. As a TA for one semester, 
								I taught three lab sections. As Head TA for three semesters, I taught two lab sections per semester. 
								This involved creating lesson plans, updating existing lab materials, advising other TA's, and leading
								telescope observing labs. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Fresno State</b>
								<br>I was a recitation leader for Calculus II for one semester, and then a recitation leader for 
								Introduction to Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism for three semesters. 
								<br>I was a Physics tutor for one year.
